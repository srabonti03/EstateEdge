## Project Features

### User Roles and Authentication

- Implementation of three distinct user roles: Customer, Agent, and Administrator.
- Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with role-based access control.
- Users have personalized dashboards and profiles with update capabilities.

### Property Management

- Agents can create, edit, and manage property listings.
- Property listings require administrative approval prior to publication.
- Customers can browse, filter, and save properties to their profiles.
- Listings provide comprehensive details including amenities, location coordinates, utilities, and pet policies.
- Images are uploaded via Multer, securely stored in the server's file system, and dynamically linked with user profiles and listings.

### Responsive Design and Accessibility

- The application is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using SCSS media queries and modular layout structures.
- Accessibility considerations include semantic HTML, alt text for images, and color contrast for better UX.

### Communication System

- Integrated real-time chat functionality enabling:
  - Direct messaging between customers and agents.
  - Live chat support with administrators via Crisp AI chatbot integration.
- **Email communication** system for contacting site administrators:
  - Emails sent via frontend using **EmailJS** (without exposing backend credentials).
  - Automated responses confirming receipt.

### Recruitment and Career Module

- Dynamic recruitment posts for agent and administrator positions.
- Application submission with relevant documentation including CVs and portfolios.
- Administrative review and management of applicant status (approve/reject/promote).

### Administrative Dashboard and Controls

- Real-time data visualization with charts and metrics for:
  - Total number of users and agents.
  - Property listings including pending approvals.
  - Geographic distribution and pricing trends of properties.
- Full administrative control over users, properties, and recruitment posts.
- Ability to deactivate/reactivate agent accounts and modify user roles.
- Utilized **Recharts** library (including BarChart, PieChart, and more) to display dynamic charts for user statistics, pricing trends, and property distributions.
